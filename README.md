# ConstrainedDynamicsExperiments
A set of codes made during understanding of constrained Lagrangian dynamics for efficient simulation of inextensible cloth (ESIC). For these experiments, Processing and C++ will be used. Processing may be downloaded from https://processing.org/download/. 

# Running the code
## Processing
Simply open the .pde file and press the play button.

##C++
Open the VisualStudio solution file (.sln) and press build button.
